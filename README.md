## Description
For this challenge, I was required to create a quiz using Javascript features. The quiz was to have a timer, ask questions, and deduct points/time if an incorrect answer was chosen. 

## Installation
 Creating HTML, CSS, and Javascript from scratch, I first layed out the html of my quiz. I then created the start button, and the timer. The timer displays throughout the entire quiz. I next created my questions in an array, and the answers to each individual question also had their own array. 

 I used several functions to program the quiz, beginning with startQuiz, setInterval to start the timer, and clearInterval to end the timer and quiz. I used renderQuestion to allow te user to see the next question after answering each question. I used createElement to create the buttons for the answers to the questions. I used useAnswer to show in the console if the choice was correct or incorrect. I used secondsLeft-=15 to subtract 15 seconds if a wrong answer was chosen. 

 This was a very challenging assignment because I had to use functions in complex ways and think outside of the box.
